        <p class="about-text">Hello, my name is Mateusz Borkowski. I am keen on watching anime and netflix. I also enjoy playing chess and programming. I am a talkative and humoristic person. I love meeting new people with skill and cooperating with them. I have been coding since 2018, when I built my first website. </p>
        <p *ngIf="screenWidth >= 1024" class="about-text">Nowadays I am mostly interested in Angular. I have started learning this technology at the end of 2021 and it feels good to me. In the future I'd like to become a regular backend developer, because I love doing it. Futhermore I want to expand my knowledge about designing websites, backend technologies and obviously new frameworks.</p>
